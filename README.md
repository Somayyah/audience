# audience

This is audience.exe
when you click the mouse, it plays clapping and cheering sounds so it feels like someone is proud of you.

i made this because sometimes it helps
and i wanted to try the windows API

there is no settings menu because i don’t know how to do that yet  
also the sound is kind of loud sorry but you can edit the level and recompile the binary

to stop the program:
you can open task manager and end it from there
or restart the computer (it doesn’t stay after that)
